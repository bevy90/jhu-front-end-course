                <p>Fried chicken has been described as being "crunchy" and "juicy",
					as well as "crispy".[20] In addition, the dish has also been called "spicy" and "salty".
					Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with a chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste.
					This is especially common in fast food restaurants and chains such as KFC. 
					The dish is traditionally served with mashed potato, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and biscuits.<br/>
					The dish is renowned for being greasy, especially when coming from fast food outlets.
					It has even been reported that some of those who enjoy eating the food limit themselves to eating it only 
					a certain number of times a year, to keep their fat intake reasonably low.
					Out of the various parts of the animal used in fried chicken, the wings generally tend to contain the most fat, 
					with almost 40 grams (0.088 lb) of fat for every 100 grams (0.22 lb).
					However, the average whole fried chicken contains only around 12% fat, or 12 grams (0.026 lb) 
					per every 100 grams (0.22 lb).[27] As well as this, 100 grams (0.22 lb) grams of fried chicken 
					generally contains around 240 calories of energy.</p>

				<h3 class="smallTitle">Thin marinated slices of beef grilled on stove top griddle</h3>
                <p>Bulgogi is made from thin slices of sirloin or other prime cuts of beef.
					Before cooking, the meat is marinated to enhance its flavor and tenderness with a mixture of soy sauce, 
					sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ground black pepper, and other ingredients such as scallions, ginger, 
					onions or mushrooms, especially white button mushrooms or matsutake. Pureed pears and onions are often 
					used as tenderizers. Sometimes, cellophane noodles are added to the dish, which varies by the region and specific recipe.<br/>
					Bulgogi is traditionally grilled, but pan-cooking has become popular as well. Whole cloves of garlic, 
					sliced onions and chopped green peppers are often grilled or fried with the meat.
					This dish is sometimes served with a side of lettuce or other leafy vegetable, 
					which is used to wrap a slice of cooked meat, often along with a dab of ssamjang, 
					or other side dishes, and then eaten together.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Seafood</h3>
				<h3 class="smallTitle">Main Course combining breaded and fried shrimps with beef steak</h3>
                <p>Surf and turf is the land and the sea all on one plate. It is steak (turf) with seafood (surf) like lobster, 
					shrimp, prawns or crab legs. Popularized in the 1960’s, this dish represents two gourmet tastes placed 
					together in a meal. This dish has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity. It is great way 
					to indulge for a special occasion or a date night.<br/>
					Aside from having both steak and seafood on a plate, the “surf” and “turf” often share a sauce, 
					like a garlic butter sauce, to unite the flavors of the meat and seafood. 
					This recipe can be served with the surf on top of the turf or the surf can be served alongside the turf. 
					If the surf is larger than the turf you may want to serve them next to each other.</p>
